# About 

Manuscript is the digital analogue to a bound notebook of staff paper. It uses OCR to transform your handwritten notes to digitalized notes in real time.

It takes the form of an Android app that turns handwriting into neatly written sheet music. 

This project is for my Senior Capstone project at Hendrix College.

For training the OCR, I am using the [HOMUS dataset](https://grfia.dlsi.ua.es/homus/) by Jorge Calvo:

**Scientific Publication**: J. Calvo-Zaragoza and J. Oncina, "Recognition of Pen-Based Music Notation: The HOMUS Dataset," 2014 22nd International Conference on Pattern Recognition, Stockholm, 2014, pp. 3038-3043. [DOI: 10.1109/ICPR.2014.524](http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICPR.2014.524)
